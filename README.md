# Data Visualization
This animated data visualization with Plotly can be found at https://life-expectation-gdppca-viz.herokuapp.com/.

The animation showing world life expectancy against GDP per capita was inspired by Hans Rosling https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo and Giles McMullen-Klein's youtube video https://youtu.be/oYVLxaxn3Dg.

The aim of my approach is above all to share this visualization with as many people as possible by deploying it on Heroku. 
Those who want to know more about the code and files that allowed the deployment of the application can refer to my GitHub repository: https://github.com/rmerzouki/Data-Visualization.
