# Data Visualization
This animated data visualization with Plotly, powered by Streamlit, and deployed on Heroku is available at https://life-expectation-gdppca-viz.herokuapp.com/.

The animation showing world life expectancy against GDP per capita was inspired by Hans Rosling https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo and Giles McMullen-Klein's youtube video https://youtu.be/oYVLxaxn3Dg.

The aim of my approach is on the one hand to share this visualization with as many people as possible by deploying it on Heroku and on the other hand to demonstrate how easy it is to build relevant visualisation from raw data in ways both people enjoy and understand. 
Those who want to know more about the code and files that allowed the deployment of the application can refer to my GitHub repository: https://github.com/rmerzouki/Data-Visualization.
